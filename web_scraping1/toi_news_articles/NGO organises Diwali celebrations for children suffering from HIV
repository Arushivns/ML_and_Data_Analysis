Madurai: A youth volunteer NGO, Padikattugal, organised Diwali celebration for children, who have been tested HIV positive, a fortnight ahead of the festival this year. 

The children wore new clothes, burst crackers, disbursed sweets among their friends and had a sumptuous lunch on Saturday.

While many of them have single parent, some of them are orphans and all of them belong to poor economic background, who cannot afford to celebrate the festival lavishly.

Padikattugal has been supporting the HIV positive children and has been giving new clothes to the children during the occasion every year. 

This year the children got a chance to choose the clothes they want. 

Thirty six children in the age group of six to 17 were taken to a textile store in the city and they purchased the dresses of their choice. 

“We requested the textile store to open one hour in advance so that the children would not get stuck in the Diwali rush. Employees at the shop were kind enough to help us. Donors, who saw our post seeking help, had come forward to gift dresses to the children,” said M Kishore Kumar, founder of Padikattugal and a software engineer.

“After shopping, we were taken to a venue where we celebrated the festival much in advance. We enjoyed the day,” said one child.

M Kayalvizhi, coordinator of the event, said that they had kept a donation box in the textile store, where the children went for shopping. They had received good response and made use of the money to purchase clothes for 50 more children hailing from remote parts of the district. While many had bought dresses for themselves, a few could not make it. Clothes and other goods will reach them soon, she said.
