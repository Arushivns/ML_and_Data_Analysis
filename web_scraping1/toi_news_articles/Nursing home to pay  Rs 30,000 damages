KOLKATA: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission has penalized South Suburban Clinic Private Ltd for wrongly diagnosing a patient as HIV-positive after a blood test. The nursing home refused to operate upon the patient saying he was HIV-positive, whereas results of two subsequent tests at Calcutta National Medical College showed his blood samples tested negative to HIV. The panel directed the nursing home to pay a compensation of Rs 30,000 to the patient. 


Debojit Kumar Ghosh was admitted to the New Alipore nursing home on December 4 last year for a fistula surgery the next day. Hours before the surgery, the patient was told that he was HIV-positive and he couldn't be operated upon. 

The judgment copy signed by WBCERC chairperson Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Roy and four members also warned the nursing home.
