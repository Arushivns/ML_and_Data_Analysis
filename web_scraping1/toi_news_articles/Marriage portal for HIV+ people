AHMEDABAD: A matrimonial portal for HIV positive people was launched at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, (IIM-A) on Tuesday and was handed over to Gujarat State Network of Positive People (GSNP) an organization run by the HIV-positive people and for the HIV positive people. 

A team of researchers led by professor Rajesh Chandwani, head of Centre for Management of Health Services (CMHS) at IIM-A was working on a project with GSNP to develop the web portal to facilitate marriage amongst HIV positive people in Gujarat. 

Professor Ashish Nanda, Director of IIM-A, said, “The marriage portal will have a positive impact on the lives of individuals living with HIV, as also on the communities within which they live. This project demonstrates the direct impact on society of some of the work being done at IIM-A.”

Chandwani said that they have taken one and half years to design the content and around six months to make the website. “We have taken special precautions to protect the identity and confidentiality of the people living with HIV,” he said.
