Participating in the debate on SC/ST (Protection of Atrocities) Bill, 2018, Shiv Sena MP Arwind Sawant said the government had brought a legilstation to restore "dilution" of the SC/ST Act following Supreme Court verdict. It should do the same on the verdict putting a 50 per cent ceiling on reservation. the party said.

"Why not change the SC order on 50 per cent reservation in jobs? Why so much fear?" he said.

He lauded Tamil Nadu government for enhancing reservation to 69 per cent.

He also said that the amended bill does not talk of punishment for misuse of the provisions and false complaints.

"But what is the punishment for those who abuse the people of upper caste? What is the provision of punishment if someone files false cases under the SC/ST Act?" he asked.

Sawant said the party opposes emhpasis on caste in politics and had opposed the Mandal Commission report.

Shiv Sena is an ally of BJP in the ruling National Democratic Alliance .

Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), another constituent of NDA, also demanded that reservation provisions should go beyond 50 per cent.

Participating in the debate, RLSP leader Upendra Kushwaha also demanded creation of All India Judicial Service to give representation to weaker sections in the judiciary.
