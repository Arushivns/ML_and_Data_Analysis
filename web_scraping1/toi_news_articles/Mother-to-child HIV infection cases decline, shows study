Nashik: A recent study has revealed that no case of HIV mother-to-child transmission has been registered in the district so far during the current fiscal.

The study was conducted by the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre, Nashik. 

Senior medical officer at the centre Sunil Thakur told TOI, “During the last financial year there was only one such case. And it’s a positive sign as until a few years ago, the infection rate from mother-to-child was 25% across the country. Now it is 5%.”

The number of cases of HIV transmission from mother to child had come down from nine in 2013-14 to one in the last fiscal.

“This year we checked 55 infants and there has been not a single case of mother-to-child infection,” he added.

He said it is encouraging that the government in July had issued a directive to all HIV-positive patients start ART, irrespective of their CD4 count. CD4 cells fight infections, but the HIV virus kills them. 

Medical experts at the ART centre said, if diagnosed and treated early with proper ART, HIV-positive patients can live for over 30 years. 

For the convenience of patients, the health department has started four ART Link centres in Manmad, Chandwad, Yeola and Niphad.

Health officials said over the years there has been a dip in the number of patients registered as HIV positive.
