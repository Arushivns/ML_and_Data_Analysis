THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ongoing US visit of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and health minister K K Shailaja has paved the way for a likely research collaboration between the state health department and two US health institutions. 


The delegation held talks with two institutes - Institute of Human Virology (IHV) in Baltimore and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center under the Thomas Jefferson University - about a possible collaboration in virology and cancer research. 

The initial feedback was reportedly positive. 

On Saturday, IHV felicitated Vijayan and Shailaja on its Baltimore campus for the state's successful handling of the Nipah virus outbreak in Kozhikode. IHV co-founder and renowned researcher Dr Robert Gallo, who was part of the team that identified HIV virus, also handed over mementos to the duo. P 5
