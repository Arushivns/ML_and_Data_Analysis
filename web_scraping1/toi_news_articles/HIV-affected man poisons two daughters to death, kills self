COIMBATORE: A 37-year-old HIV-affected man has murdered his two daughters by feeding them poison filled capsules, before committing suicide in a similar fashion at Chinna Sengulam forest settlement area near Anthiyur in Erode district on Saturday night.

The deceased were identified as I Chikkannan alias Chikkaran, of Chinna Sengulam, and his children C Sudha, 15, and C Megala, 10. Sudha was a Class IX student of a private school at Ammapettai, while Megala was a Class VI student of a private residential school at Anthiyur. Both were staying in hostels. A farm worker, Chikkaran had separated from his wife Chikkari about eight years ago. “He was taking care of his two daughters. He was tested HIV positive a few years ago and he had been taking treatment at the Erode government hospital. As his health condition deteriorated, he was recently told that he could live for just two more years,” an investigation officer said.

On Saturday evening, Chikkaran took his daughters to the house from their hostels and fed them capsules filled with poison. Later, he also consumed the same. When a neighbour came to their house at night, he saw the trio struggling for lives with forth in their mouth. Immediately, the trio were taken to the Anthiyur government hospital, where doctors declared Megala brought dead. Sudha and Chikkaran were referred to the government hospital in Erode, where Sudha died without responding to the treatment on the early hours of Sunday. Chikkaran also died in the hospital in the evening.
