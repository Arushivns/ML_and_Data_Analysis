MEERUT: Meerut is set to get a district counselling centre, called ‘man kaksh’, where mental health patients will be able to discuss their ‘mann ki baat’. The centre is the first of its kind in the district. The centre is a part of the National Mental Health programme and will be run in association with the mental health unit here. An estimated 150 million individuals are said to have mental health issues in the country. 


“Under the National Mental Health programme, a district counselling centre will soon be started at PL Sharma District Hospital where patients with mental illness will be able to share their problems with counsellors. Apart from counsellors from mental health unit, counsellors appointed for other units like AIDS and tuberculosis will also be available here,” said Dr PK Bansal, superintendent-in-chief of the district hospital.

The counselling centre will function once a week but the day for it is still to be decided. The mental health unit was set at the district hospital last year. Earlier, a mental health unit was available only at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College.

“People do not consider disorders like anxiety as a mental disease, which eventually leads to stress, hypertension and blood pressure. Every individual who has a physical disease also goes through a mental disease side by side and it can be treated only by counselling. The district counselling centre will aim at solving problems of local people by listening to the reasons behind their anxiety and apprehensions,” said Vibha Nagar, clinical psychologist, mental health unit, PL Sharma district hospital.
