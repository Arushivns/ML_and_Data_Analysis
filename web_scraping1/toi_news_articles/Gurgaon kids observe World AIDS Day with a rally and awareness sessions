Gurgaon observed World AIDS day yesterday with a rally. Organised by Desire Society, a city-based NGO, and Government Senior Secondary School, the rally, which took place near Civil Hospital, saw participation from children, doctors and teachers.

The morning started with sessions by several doctors, where they told students about causes and prevention of HIV/AIDS. "Awareness is the key. If people know about it, they will be cautious and that is the way to beat this disease. Seventy per cent of AIDS cases are due to sexual transmission, and the other 30% cases are due to infected needles and parent-child transfer. The later can be controlled by proper screening and by creating awareness among people," said Ashish Maheshwari from the NGO.

Some of kids in the rally were HIV-affected as well. 13-year-old Shilpa* told us that she found out that she has HIV only last year. "I love to draw and I want to become a doctor and treat this disease," she said.

Another kid in the rally, Ajay*, said, "I want to do very well in my studies and love playing cricket. I have many friends at school and donâ€™t feel any different from the rest of the children."
