With one more month to year-end, Goa is optimistic that 2017 will reveal a decline in the number of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) cases compared to last year. In 2016, 378 people tested positive for HIV while 317 tested positive till October this year. AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) cases, however, have already seen a rise during the first 10 months this year compared to last year. There have been 25 deaths due to AIDS till October this year, compared to 31 last year. 




“What should happen is that anyone who has the slightest doubt should subject themselves to testing,” an official from the Goa State Aids Control Society said.

Around 40% of HIV positive people don’t know their HIV status and are hidden in the community, either due to ignorance or the stigma associated with it. 

“Earlier people would be hesitant to get themselves tested because they thought there was no hope. Now they know there’s treatment available and there’s some light at the end of the tunnel,” the official said, adding that only once the stigma goes away will more people step forward to get themselves tested.

Thanks to the test-and-treat policy rolled out by the government in April this year, those who have tested positive for HIV can avail free antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the past, the therapy was provided only when a person’s CD4 count went below normal and if it was clinically felt that his resistance had gone down.

“Now every person who tests positive can be put on treatment, ensuring that his viral load is kept low, thereby preventing him from contracting AIDS early on,” he said, citing examples of people who have lived up to 25 years after being tested HIV+.
