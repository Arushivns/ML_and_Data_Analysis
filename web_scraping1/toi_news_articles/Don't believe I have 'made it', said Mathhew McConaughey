Mathhew McConaughey said he does not believe he has 'made it' in Hollywood. The 48-year-old actor, who has hits such as 'Dallas Buyers Club', 'Interstellar' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street', among others to his credit, said he does not take his successes and failures seriously. 


"I don't believe that, 'Ah, I'm Matthew McConaughey. I'm 48, I've got a family, I've got a wife, I've got three kids, everyone's healthy right now, I've got a career, I've won an Oscar'. It's not like, 'Oh, I did it'," McConaughey told.

"There's chapters of success and failures but there's not a spot where you get to take a deep breath and go 'I've finally made it'. Then you become stagnant. That's not as fun," he added. 

The actor, who shot to fame after featuring in 1993 hit 'Dazed and Confused', went on to win a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as AIDS patient Ron Woodroof in 'Dallas Buyers Club'.
