KANPUR: In a shocking incident, the callousness of a quack has led to at least 20 persons having been found HIV positive in UP's Unnao. After it was learnt that the quack used the same needle for all the victims, the health department lodged a complaint with Bangarmau police station. 

In Bangarmau tehsil, the quack travelling on a bicycle ended up giving HIV infection to the patients he had treated injecting the same needle even as medical tests are being conducted to confirm the same. 

In Novemeber 2017, an NGO organised a health campaign where some people were found carrying HIV symptoms. On further medical tests, they were found HIV positive. In course of counselling them, it was found that the quack used to treat people with the same needle over and over again and it was believed it is how the infection spread.

Senior officials, on knowing this, organised three health camps. Out of 400 people, 40 were found with the symptoms. Twenty persons, including some kids, have been confirmed to be HIV positive, while the rest are being tested in ART Centre, Kanpur.

Medical superintendent of CHC Dr Pramod Kumar Dohre has filed the complaint against unknown persons. Inspector Arun Kumar Singh says that investigation is on. The list of victims and details about the accused have been asked from the health department. Arrest will be made on the basis of victims' statement.
