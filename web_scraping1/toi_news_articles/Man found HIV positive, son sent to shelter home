NOIDA: A 6-year old child was sent to shelter home after his father, aged 40, was found HIV positive on Wednesday. The father and son from West Bengal had recently come to Noida in search of a job.

Satya Prakash, manager FXB Suraksha-Childline, said that the man worked as a mason. “He belongs to a lower middle class family. He fell ill and was admitted in district hospital Noida last week. In the diagnosis, it was found that he was suffering from HIV positive,” he said. The doctors referred him to LNJP Hospital for better medical care.

Kallu, a resident of Khoda Colony, had earlier met the victim and offered accommodation in his house. However, when he came to know that he was suffering from disease, he expressed unwillingness to continue with the favour.

Prakash said that the boy has been sent to a shelter home after presenting before the child welfare committee. “We will send the boy for a medical test to check if he is safe from the disease. We have come to know that the patient’s wife is pregnant and is based in West Bengal. We will get in touch with her for medical consultation to ensure the baby, when delivered, is safe,” he said.
