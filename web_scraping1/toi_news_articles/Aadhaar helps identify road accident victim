AHMEDABAD: It was an aadhaar card which helped residents to identify an accident victim who was crushed by a speeding car in the BRT corridor near Cadila Bridge in Isanpur on Sunday. The vehicle sped away after the accident with no one noticing the registration number. Harsha Purohit (48) was returning back home in the evening when she was hit by the car.

Social worker Harshad Patel said iron barricade of the BRT corridor at the entrance is broken and many cross the corridor from that spot.

“In the last one month, there have been five fatal accidents in the corridor in which speeding vehicles have hit pedestrians and two-wheeler drivers. Immediate repairs are required to avert such accidents,” said Patel.

According to police sources, Purohit had parked her two-wheeler on the side of the road and was crossing the corridor on foot for some work on the opposite side of the road.

“She was in the middle of the road when the speeding car dashed into her and flung her about 20 feet away. She sustained serious head injuries. We found her aadhaar card from the purse and informed her son about the tragic incident. He rushed to the spot and took her to a nearby hospital but she died on the way,” added a local resident.

Police have registered a case of causing death due to rash driving and driving in the dedicated BRT corridor against the unknown car driver. “We have gathered CCTV footage of the accident and will identify the accused soon,” added a senior police official.
