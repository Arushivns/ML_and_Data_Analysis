Well sure, indulging in oral sex can make one prone to various kinds of sexually transmitted infections but what about being on the receiving end of it? Most people think that until they are getting in contact with another's genitals, they won't get an STD. However, is that true?


Unfortunately, even receiving unprotected oral sex can put one at the risk of getting a sexual infection. While when one gives another a head, they definitely expose themselves to diseases such as HIV, herpes and gonorrhea. However, even if one receives it, he is at risk.

If oral sex is had without a condom or dental dam, the receiver can get herpes, syphilis, hepatitis B and even gonorrhea and chlamydia. Herpes is passed on from skin-to-skin contact and can happen even without the exchange of fluids. Diseases like gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect one's throat, hence can transfer even while one just receives oral sex.

What's the prevention? Simply use protection. Condom and dental dams are meant to prevent the transfer of STDs. Also, you and your partner must get tested regularly to avoid any risks.
