THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has urged everyone to join the global conversation to raise awareness about HIV. "HIV is one of the most destructive pandemics in the history of humanity. Millions of people are infected with HIV worldwide. 

The search for an HIV vaccine has been so far unsuccessful, but recent advancements in the field have renewed hope in defeating this fatal illness," said the chief minister in a statement issued here on Friday on the occasion of World AIDS Day.

He said World AIDS Day was an opportunity to show solidarity with the millions of people who were living with the disease. 

"It is also a time to fight against the stigma prevailing in the society. Let us pledge on this AIDS day that we will not indulge in actions or thoughts that will make life more difficult for the victims, he added.

Health minister K K Shylaja, who inaugurated the state-level World AIDS Day observance said the society should be compassionate towards the HIV positive people. The government was striving hard to bring these people back to the mainstream and ensure a proper rehabilitation of them, he said.

The minister said all these would succeed only if the society also supports these patients and give them the confidence to come back to normal life.
