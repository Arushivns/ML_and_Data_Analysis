HYDERABAD: Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have reported the highest number of people with sexually-transmitted diseases in the country, according to National Health Profile of India 2018.


The report says, in 2016 around 8,056 cases of syphilis, that amount to 35 per cent of total cases, was reported in Telangana alone. In 2017, Andhra Pradesh reported the highest number of syphilis cases: around 5,155. For gonorrhoea, Telangana reported the highest number of cases (19,884) followed by AP in 2016; in 2017 AP recorded highest in the country.

Centre has released the report on the health profile of various states on June 19. Health experts disagree with the Centre.

Robotic urologist and microsurgical andrologist Dr Kammela Sridhar said, “Promiscuity is high in the two states. Genital hygiene and nonuse of condom and improper use of condom are general factors. Homosexuality has increased. The risk of transmitting STDs and HIV is 16 times more in homosexuals.”


Heavy sweating affects genital hygiene: Doctors
According to National Health Profile of India 2018, Telangana and AP have reported the highest number of people with sexually-transmitted diseases in India.

Robotic urologist and microsurgical andrologist Dr Kammela Sridhar said, “In Telangana and AP obesity is highest in the country. Due to fat in the body, the immune system is less effective. Due to heavy sweating, particularly in AP coast, genital hygiene is affected. Tamil Nadu has worked well to bring down STDs and HIV.”

However, dermatologists say figures by Union health ministry should be relooked into and could be defective.

Dermatologist Dr George Valsan of Sarada Hospital in Sainikpuri says, “We have been receiving a number of cases of syphilis and gonococcal infections. In 8,000-10,000 patients, I get two or three cases of gonorrhoea a year. Syphilis has also drastically increased. Around 4-5 cases are reported a month. Maybe, more cases are reported in government hospitals. But the figures put out by the Centre should be revisited. HIV infections are there. Almost 65% are fungal infections like candidiasis, and viral infections like herpes simplex have increased.”

In January 2018, an Osmania and Gandhi Medical College and ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune, study found that multi-drug resistant strains of gonorrhoea were seen. At least 20 cases in Secunderabad and 16 in Hyderabad, verified by researchers, were found. A total of 98% isolates of gonorrhoea were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 52% to penicillin, 56% tetracycline and 5% azithromycin.

AP also recorded highest number of acute respiratory infection deaths and cases after UP. In 2017, due to acute respiratory infections, 324 people died in AP and 26 in Telangana.
