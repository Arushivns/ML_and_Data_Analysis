Nagpur: HIV infection is known to bring many other infections along with it. In South Africa it is increasingly leading to brain infections. Doctors claimed that HIV/AIDS is also increasing the incidence of strokes and epilepsy.

Dr John Ouma, of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told TOI that though the commonest of infection that comes with HIV is tuberculosis, HIV infection and seizures were also related. 

“Hence, epilepsy was a common disease. One in hundred persons suffers from epilepsy at some point of time in life. In fact, Neuro-AIDS is a commonly used word in South Africa and neuro-cognitive disorders caused due AIDS are a topic of research,” he said.

Dr Ouma is in the city for the five-day annual conference of the Neurological Society of India being hosted by the Nagpur Neuro Society. 

Dr Ouma said that Africa had a very small number of neurologists and neurosurgeons. Hence, a large number of the patients from Africa come to India for treatment. 

“India has a majority of the advanced equipment and innovation in the field. The treatment here is available at less than one fourth the cost of the developed countries. Hence a lot of medical tourism happens between India and South Africa,” he said. 

Medical tourism, Dr Ouma said, was possible also due to the liberal policies of the Indian government unlike the USA which asks for “cumbersome paper work”.

Dr Ouma said that despite all the developments in the brain sciences, man seems to have understood less than 5% of the functioning of the brain. “There is so much of scope for research in neurosciences, neurobiology, neuropathology etc that amazing work can be done by neurologists and neurosurgeons in future when they understand the brain more,” he said.
