JALANDHAR: The health department has sealed a private blood bank in Jalandhar and seized its records after finding major irregularities in its operations following a surprise raid on Friday night. The team found 44 units of blood lying in the open at ‘Rakat Vahini India’ running from Gulab Devi Hospital when it raided the premises following a tip off by activists of an NGO. 


“We were already suspecting irregularities in the blood bank. On Friday night, we were informed by the staff of a private hospital that they had been provided two units of blood bearing same donation number. We reached the blood bank immediately and even informed the authorities,” said Neeraj Bakshi of Hindustan Welfare Blood Donors Club, Phagwara. The club has a network of over 5,000 blood donors and is involved in promoting volunteer blood donation.

On Saturday evening Zonal Licensing Authority Karun Sachdev said they had seized 44 units of blood and record of the blood bank. “Initial investigations reveal glaring violations of rules of storing and handling the blood,” he said. Out of the 44 units seized, 25 were lying outside the refrigerators when they should have been stored at 2-6 degree temperature, he said. “Donation and expiry dates were also not mentioned on the blood bags. All the seized bags should now be tested for HIV, Hepatitis C and B virus among others, as is the standard procedure to find out if infected blood was also being issued for patients,” he added. 

The blood bank is owned by Dr I G Aggarwal, originally from Tohana in Haryana. “He runs around 10 blood banks in Punjab and Haryana,” said Bakshi. 

ACP Dalbir Singh Buttar said that a case was also being registered against the accused.
