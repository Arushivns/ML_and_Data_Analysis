KOLKATA: Lakshman Chandra Bera, a science teacher from Sabang, has been advocating the cause of blood test before marriage. Bera stressed that there is no need to match horoscope before marriage, but blood tests are mandatory to ensure that the bride and groom lead a healthy and happy life in future. 


On Monday, he married off his daughter. But before that he set an example for others to follow. He made sure that the bride and groom go through a thorough blood test procedure before they tie knot. Not only this, he organised a discussion on the need for blood tests before marriage ahead of the wedding ceremony. He also arranged a blood test camp at the venue. Apart from blood group determination, HIV screening was also done. 

The invitees also listened to the discussion with rapt attention. Along with the invitation card, pamphlets were also distributed. The only aim of Lakshman Chandra Bera is to educate the masses about the health issues related to blood. His initiative was appreciated by Girish Chandra Bera, the Chief Health Officer of West Midnapore. 

The groom, Rathin Biswas, a professor from Kalyani, had readily agreed to his father-in-law's proposal of a blood test. Bera's daughter Sunita wholeheartedly supported her father's decision. 

When asked about this initiative, Lakshman Chandra Bera said, "Many people criticised my effort. People laughed at me. I have remained silent all these years and waited for the right moment. I started with my own family."

Headmaster of Narayanbarh High School, Chaitanya Charan Das welcomed this initiative. 

"I haven't seen anything like this before in my whole life. It's absolutely a different experience to talk about the positive sides of blood test amidst wedding preparations," Das said.
