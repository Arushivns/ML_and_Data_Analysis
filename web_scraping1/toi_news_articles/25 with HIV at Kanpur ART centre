KANPUR: Among the 58 people of Unnao district who had been found infe cted with HIV, 25 so far have c ontacted doctors at the anti-retro viral therapy (ART) centre in Kanpur. They have been counselled by the doctors and are currently on medication. 

 Doctors at the centre after doing the registration have also taken the case study of all these patients. 

 Blood samples of all these had been sent for CD4 count test. Dr Chaman Vanwani of ART Centre said, apart from medical care, patient infected with HIV needed moral support too. 

 "We have done counselling of all people who had come from Unnao. They have been put on anti-retroviral therapy", he added. 

 Talking about the growing number of cases of HIV with infected syringes, Dr Vanwani said, people of rural pockets are most vulnerable of getting infected. 

 "Earlier also, while discussing history of patients, we had found people getting infected with HIV by a quack. But we haven't come across such a big number of people getting infected with HIV in a single case," he added. 

 "Threat from quacks has always been overlooked. It should be urgently addressed. The number of people contracting the virus due to infected syringes has increased manifolds, especially in rural areas," he added further. 

 Situated at IDH (Infectious Disease Hospital) - an associated hospital of Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) hospital - it's an ART plus centre (higher centre where patients are referred from other districts). 

 It covers patien ts from Kanpur Dehat, Unna o, Farukhabad, Kannauj, Fathepur and Hamirpur.
