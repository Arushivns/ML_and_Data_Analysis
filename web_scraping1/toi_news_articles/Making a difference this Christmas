The true spirit of Christmas is about spreading love and care, and St Claret PU College did just that recently. As part of the annual crib making competition, college principal Fr Sojan Abraham invited underprivileged children, those infected with HIV and orphans to join the celebrations. It was a day of creative cribs, hundreds of red hats, Christmas carols and many smiling faces that adorned the college campus.
