PANAJI: Around 2000 TB cases are detected each year in Goa, the state tuberculosis officer and chief medical officer of the revised national tuberculosis control programme, Dr Maximiano De Sa said on Friday.


Since a very small proportion of the cases detected in the private sector are not notified and brought to the notice of the government, he said it is high time that private and public sector join hands to eliminate TB in the state. 





“Goa has a strong private sector which is 50:50. Many TB patients prefer private doctors, as first point of contact, because of privacy issue. We need strong support from our colleagues in the private sector, in notifying such TB cases,” he stated during the state launch of Joint Effort to Eliminate TB (JEET) at Panaji. 

Notified patients will be offered drugs free of cost supplied by WHO qualified pharma companies which undergo stringent quality check mechanisms. Notified patients will also be provided with associated services like HIV testing, multi drug resistance testing, counseling and chemo prophylaxis he stated.

While De Sa highlighted the problem of undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed and treated TB, he said the emergence of a deadly form of the disease i.e drug resistant TB is a bigger worry. “TB spreads very easily because it is airborne and there is already a threat of this drug resistant TB spreading,” he stated.

He also added that the government of India recently launched a social support scheme to help all TB patients by offering them Rs 500 each month for the entire duration of their treatment i.e 6-8 months and for multi drig resistant TB- 2 years. Around 300 patients in the state have availed of this scheme he stated. 

The JEET project aims for intensive engagement of private sector to achieve universal access to quality diagnosis and treatment for TB and help the nation in achieving The National Strategic Plan to eliminate TB by 2025.
