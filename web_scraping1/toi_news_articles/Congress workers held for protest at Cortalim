VASCO/MARGAO: Twenty-eight members of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC), including its president Girish Chodankar, were placed under preventive arrest on Thursday morning while they were heading to the Cortalim junction to protest bad traffic management and road conditions in the area. The demonstration prompted an emergency meet at the secretariat, where the issue was discussed by the chief secretary, police representatives and PWD officials 


A police team, headed by south Goa SP Arvind Gawas, intercepted motorcycle-borne GPCC workers at the Thana junction in an attempt to diffuse the protest and avert a bigger traffic snarl. When the workers, of which Mahila Congress president Pratima Coutinho was also a part, refused to back down and goaded the public to walk with them from Cortalim to Agasaim, they were arrested. 

The arrested GPCC workers, including eight women, were later released on personal bonds. Congress has given the state three days to remedy the traffic situation, failing which it has threatened to stage another agitation from Agasaim. Sources said PWD has assured to repair the roads within the next three days only if it didnâ€™t rain for at least one whole day.
