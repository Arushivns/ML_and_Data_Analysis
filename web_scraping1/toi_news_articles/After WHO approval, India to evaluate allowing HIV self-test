The World Health Organisation (WHO) for the first time has recommended HIV self-testing in the privacy of one's home using HIV kit, a move that may result in a major breakthrough in HIV treatment by improving access to diagnosis. Though India now does not allow HIV self-test, the UN agency's guidance has even prompted the health ministry here to evaluate the proposal.

“We will certainly look at WHO's recommendations and evaluate how it can be adopt ed,“ said C K Mishra, secretary to the health ministry.

The move assumes significance as the lack of HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to reducing the burden of the infection worldwide because it hinders the government and public health agency to offer anti-retroviral therapy or other treatment options to those suffering from the disease.

Estimates show around 87% of HIV-infected people in India are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus. Globally , around 40% of all people with HIV or over 14 million remain unaware of their status.

Self-testing will be particularly relevant for those people who may find it difficult to access testing in clinical settings and might prefer self-testing as their method of choice.

HIV self-test can be done by individuals by using oral fluid or blood-finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results of the test can be seen within 20 minutes or less.Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. WHO recommends they receive information and links to counselling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services. A senior official said, India may initially adopt the UN agency's suggestions for self-testing among high risk communities where the incidence and chances of spread is higher. “Millions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others,“ said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general, WHO. “HIV selftesting should open the door for many more people to know their HIV status and find out how to get treatment and access prevention services.“

Estimates by National Aids Control Organization, which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 2.2 crore people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. In 2015, the total number of people living with HIV in India were estimated at 21.17 lakh, whereas 86,000 new cases were found.Though incidence of HIV in India has declined substantially since 2000 by around 66%, lack of accessibility to testing and the stigma attached to HIV poses a challenge for uptake of HIV diagnosis.
