PANAJI: Goa has finally included children infected with or living with HIV as a disadvantaged section under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. This is expected to provide protection to these children from being denied admission and from being expelled from schools. In 2014, the plight of HIV-infected children in the state came to light when 13 HIV-infected orphans were expelled from a school in Rivona after parents of other students discovered their condition and demanded they not be allowed to study in the school. The students also had to change schools twice due to the objection raised by parents of other children.

When a Delhi-based NGO petitioned the Supreme Court, and the apex court ruled in March this year that states include HIV-infected children in the disadvantaged group under RTE, the Goa government was forced to act on those lines. While the court had appreciated 11 states and union territories for already including HIV-infected children as a disadvantaged group, it turned out Goa was among the states that had not protected these children under the RTE Act, even though Goa notified its RTE rules seven years ago, in 2010.

The state finally issued the notification in September this year.

The extension of protected status to children in Goa living with or infected with HIV means that they are now entitled to special protection and measures under the terms of the RTE Act. These include eradication of discrimination, harassment, and victimisation. It will eliminate discrimination in relation to the admissions process including denying or limiting access to any benefits of enrolment or through segregation in separate study, sports, playground or canteen areas or in any other amenities provided by the school.

The disadvantaged section will also get protection from financial extortion or forced expenditure and will be entitled to reservation of seats in private institutes.
