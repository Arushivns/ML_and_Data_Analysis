TRICHY: Out of 46,079 pregnant women who were put through HIV screening test last year in Trichy, 17 were found positive and to have got infection from their husbands. 

“In most of the cases, the husbands are the reason for infecting the wives. HIV infection among women before their marriage is very negligible. Most of them come under the age group of below 30 years. The number has come down to 0.03 %,” Dr S M Manivannan, district program manager (DPM) of district AIDS prevent and control unit (DAPCU), told TOI on Saturday. 

He also said that out of 100 children born to HIV infected mothers, 30% to 35% were infected till 2013. “The chances of mother to children transmission declined after we started prescribing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to pregnant mothers also. We gradually brought the number from 10% to 4% and now reached 2%. The mission is to achieve 0% mother to children transmission,” said Dr Manivannan. 

In Trichy district, a total of 1 23,381 people underwent HIV tests in 2016-17. The tests revealed that 640 were infected by HIV. District AIDS prevention control unit said that the number of HIV infection dropped to 0.5 % from 0.7% in 2015-16. 

The statistics showed a declining trend about HIV infection in Trichy and that the number of HIV infection diagnosed through integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) was 0.82 % in 2014-15. The number of HIV infected patients which was high in 2008 and 2009 gradually declined, claimed DAPCU officials. 

The downward trend was attributed to awareness among people about safety measures such as condoms. 

“The single most important occupation affected by the HIV remains the driver profession. Previously, long distance drivers were vulnerable to HIV infection because of their long separation from their wives and the prevalence of female sex workers. Now, all kinds of drivers have come in the vulnerable group,” said Manivannan. 

Around 11,000 people were undergoing HIV screening test in all the 33 ICTC in Trichy every month. Not all of them were coming on suspicion of HIV infection, several of them with chronic illness and tuberculosis were referred by doctors for HIV screening. Pre-surgical screening of patients and pregnant women also added up to the total number.
