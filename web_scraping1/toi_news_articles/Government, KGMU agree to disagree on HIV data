LUCKNOW: Is the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Uttar Pradesh higher than what state data shows? A study by KGMU, which puts the prevalence at 3 per 1,000 people, is higher than the data available with Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS), which puts it at 1 per 1,000 people. The KGMU study puts the state higher than the national average of 2.6 per 1,000 people.

The KGMU study is based on data of regular check-up of blood donors compiled over a period of four years. KGMU is one of the few centers in India that use Nucleic Acid Test (NAT), a WHO recommended gold standard for screening of blood samples and early detection of HIV, especially among infants.


“The usual HIV testing is done using Elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test which is inferior to NAT. This means that several cases of HIV which may not be detected by Elisa are detected by NAT. Also, NAT can detect HIV in a person almost six months earlier than ELISA,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, head of transfusion in medicine department, KGMU.

But NAT is yet to be adopted by the department of health and family welfare and state health department.
