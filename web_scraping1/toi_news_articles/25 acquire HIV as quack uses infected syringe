The affected persons also include a father-son and a mother-son duo," he said."It's shocking how one person can cause such damage to society.

"Threat from quacks has always been overlooked and needs to be urgently addressed. The number of people contracting diseases due to infected syringes has shown an increase," said a senior medical college official.
