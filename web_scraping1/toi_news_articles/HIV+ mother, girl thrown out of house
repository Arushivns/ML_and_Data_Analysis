EGRA: An HIV-positive woman and her daughter in Egra were thrown out of their house by her in-laws for protesting against her husband who hid his HIV-positive status before marriage. The woman, who was diagnosed with HIV during a routine blood test, approached an NGO for treatment. There she learnt that her husband was also on the patients’ list and had been HIV-positive before their marriage in 2014. 

She has filed a case against her husband and in-laws. East Midnapore SP Alok Rajoria said, “We will act if we find evidence that they were tortured and thrown out.”
