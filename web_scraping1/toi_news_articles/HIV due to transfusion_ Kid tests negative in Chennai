THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The test conducted at the national institute for tuberculosis and research, Chennai has ruled out the presence of HIV virus in the blood sample of the child who had allegedly contracted HIV due to a blood transfusion done at the Regional Cancer Centre in Thiruvananthapuram. 

However, reliable sources from the RCC said the status of the disease can be confirmed only after the final result is obtained from the national institute in New Delhi. 

"The test done at Chennai says that HIV was not detected," said a senior doctor at the RCC. The research institute has sent the test details for a detailed evaluation to the institute in New Delhi. RCC authorities had sent the nine-year-old kid to Chennai for the detailed examination. 

After the kid was tested positive after a blood transfusion, the government and the RCC had constituted separate teams to find out the reasons behind the incident. The committee reports had made it clear that there was no fault from the RCC authorities. 

"The doctor in the medical college hospital told us that there might be chances of sample testing negative after some time," said the girl's father.
