PUNE: The Indian government launched the National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme this month with a goal of ending viral hepatitis by 2030. Under this programme, free drugs and diagnostics for hepatitis B and C will also be offered.


The initiative aims to reduce morbidity and mortality due to the disease apart from preventive and promotive interventions; collaboration with different ministries; increasing access to testing and treatment facilities; and building capacities up to sub-district level.

Medical expert KK Aggarwal said, "Viral hepatitis and HIV coinfection is a common problem and challenge to the treating clinician. People with HIV who are coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at increased risk for serious, life-threatening health complications. All people living with HIV should be tested for Hepatitis B and C infections as well."

HIV, HBV, and HCV have similar routes of transmission. They spread by contact with infected body fluids such as blood, semen and vaginal fluid, or from a mother to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. Due to these shared routes of transmission, people at risk for HIV infection are also at risk for HBV or HCV infection. Of these, HIB is more infectious."

The signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis appear quickly and include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, pale stool, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, and yellow skin and eyes, which may be signs of jaundice.
