AHMEDABAD: While the menace of drugs is worrying sections of society in Gujarat, as its discreet tentacles spread among the youth, state-based experts decided to turn to Punjab, a state with a high rate of the population undergoing rehabilitation, to understand how intervention can be planned and what strategies can be employed to counter the drug menace.

A workshop was organized by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) in Ahmedabad from June 18 to 22 as part of Unified Budget, Results and Accountability Framework (UBRAF) project where experts included psychiatrists from AIIMS and Punjab’s AIDS Control Society.

Dr Rajesh Gopal, joint director of GSACS, said that the idea was to strengthen state-based intervention centres — two located in Surat and one in Ahmedabad — with special focus on opioid substitution treatment (OST). “A team from Gujarat had recently visited rehabilitation and intervention centres in Punjab. They shared their learning with the participants. One of the major thrust areas is community outreach and timely help,” he said. The team that visited Punjab said that the first lesson is acceptance of the issue and readiness to change the situation. The majority of addicts are in the working age group and there is overwhelming number of men addicted to natural and synthetic drugs. Experts also pointed out that instead of taking patients completely off drugs, they devise a programme that gradually decreases the dosage. Madhu Sharma, national programme officer for India, UNODC, said that they have involved all stakeholders in the fight against drugs. “The training will not only enable intervention centres to improve techniques but will also reach social workers, NGOs and families. Psychiatrists, de-addiction specialists and those implementing national and local intervention programmes participated,” she said.
