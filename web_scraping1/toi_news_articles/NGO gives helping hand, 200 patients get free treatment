HYDERABAD: A city-based NGO has brought 200 sick patients into the public health system for free treatment through a door-to-door campaign. The patients were reluctant to visit a government hospital due to long queues and unhygienic conditions. They had no money for treatment in private facilities.

“Most of the patients — who we convinced to visit a government hospital — had flu-like symptoms. They were not ready to go to a hospital because they were worried that they would end up spending a lot of time in long queues. Some had this fear that their condition might deteriorate further because of the unhygienic conditions at the hospital,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president, Helping Hand Foundation.

He said that from the beginning of December, they have been able to bring in 200 patients to government hospitals. “On Friday, we encountered a case of a 10-day-old girl born to a HIV-positive couple. Her parents were finding it hard to feed the baby and the mother couldn’t feed her as she was afraid of transmitting the disease to the kid. The new born has now been provided with milk powder,” he said, adding that many patients with diabetes were also identified in the last few days and given medicines.

NGO officials said the main aim of the campaign was to check for major and minor ailments and help patients get into the public health system for free treatment. The primary focus of the NGO is on children’s health (vaccinations), TB and other chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). So far, 17 active TB cases have been identified.
