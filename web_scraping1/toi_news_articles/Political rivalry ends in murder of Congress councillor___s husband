AMRITSAR: A political rivalry ended in the murder of a Congress councillor’s husband in Jandiala Guru, a town about 18km from here, on Saturday night. 

Police have beefed up security in the town to avert any further clashes after Kulwinder Singh Kinda, the husband of Ward VI councillor Kanwaljit Kaur who belongs to the Congress, was killed in a brawl which broke out at a function the deceased had gone to.

Amritsar (rural) senior superintendent of police (SSP) Parampal Singh said they had registered a case against 15 persons, including seven unidentified men, but none of the accused had been arrested so far.

The SSP said the victim and the accused belonged to rival factions of the Congress. He said the accused were Jandiala Guru residents Sanjeev Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar Happy, Rishal Saini, Kiran Kumar, Pargat Singh , Krishan Arora, Honey Singh and Rajinder Singh.

Kinda was earlier an Akali supporter, but his wife contested the elections as an independent candidate and joined the Congress after she won.

The SSP said Kinda had gone to attend a function at the house of Vijay Kumar Malhotra. There, the accused allegedly attacked him with sharp-edged weapons after they got into a fight with Kinda’s relatives. Kinda was rushed to the hospital, but was declared brought dead.

Police have made elaborate security arrangements in Jandiala Guru to avert any further clashes, he added.
