"It feels like breathing in open airâ€¦no criminality," was what activist Arif Jafar, who has felt the scourge of Section 377, said after the verdict.


One of the petitioners in the case, Jafar remembered the 47 days he spent in jail 17 years ago. In July 2001, he and his colleagues - engaged in outreach work to educate sexual minorities about their rights - were arrested in Lucknow and charged under a provision linked to Section 377. "I feel every moment spent in jail and the struggle thereafter has been worth it now," added Jafar, who is the founder of Lucknow-based Bharosa and a part of Naz Foundation International.

Similar sentiments were voiced by activists and grassroots workers working on the issue for decades.

Transrights activist Abhina Aher, associate director of India HIV/AIDS Alliance, said, "We marked the 72nd Iday for the country this year but for us this is the first queer Independence Day."

Yashwinder Singh from Humsafar Trust, one of the petitoners, emerged with a friend from the court complex proudly wearing a rainbow scarf and loudly proclaiming "freedom". "The fear of blackmail and arrest is gone. The focus now shifts to making way for rights like marriage, adoption and inheritance," he said.
