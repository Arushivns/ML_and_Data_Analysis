THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: An HIV positive woman, who delivered a baby at SAT hospital last week, was shifted to Gandhi Bhavan in Pathanapuram on Tuesday with the support of the hospital and women’s commission. 

The woman from Karnataka, in her 40s, came to know about the HIV infection only after tests were conducted by the hospital during delivery. When the hospital checked the blood samples of her husband, he too was found to be HIV positive. It is too early to identify if their child, who is just 13-days old, has contracted the infection. Both husband and wife work here as labourers. 

The incident came to the attention of women’s commission member Shahida Kamal after some activists informed her about the incident. “On World AIDS Day, I had said that the commission would take up cases of destitute HIV positive patients. After reading my statement in newspapers, some people called me and sought help. Since Gandhi Bhavan has been taking care of three people living with AIDS for several years, I contacted them. They agreed to accept the family,” she said. 

Kamal said that the woman had no idea about AIDS. “They have no much idea how serious the situation is. A test could be conducted on the child only after 45 days,” she said. Women’s commission chairperson MC Josephine and member Shahida Kamal visited them at SAT hospital before they were taken to Pathanapuram. Josephine said that the commission would take care of their needs. 

She said that commission also intervened to prevent social ostracization of the family.
